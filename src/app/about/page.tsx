          Patwatoli: A Symbol of Perseverance and Progress<br/>
          Patwatoli, a village in Gaya, Bihar, is renowned for its skilled weavers and its extraordinary success in producing 15-20 IITians annually. Despite financial hardships, the community’s unwavering dedication to education has created an inspiring legacy.
          <br />
          <br />
          Founded in 2013 by Chandrakant Pateshwari (CP) and like-minded individuals, VRIKSH BE THE CHANGE emerged from Patwatoli to uplift underprivileged students. Motivated by a friend’s struggle to continue school, CP turned a simple belief—“What I can do, I must do”—into a movement.
          Registered as a Trust in 2017, VRIKSH operates in Education, Healthcare, Community Development, and Environment, striving for a future where every child has access to learning and opportunity. Inspired by Patwatoli’s resilience, we continue to drive change, ensuring no one is left behind.

          Empowering Education for All – Vriksh Be The Change
          <br />
          At Vriksh Be The Change, our primary goal is to educate students who are unable to attend school due to financial barriers. To ensure no child is deprived of learning, we provide free basic stationery like notebooks, pens, pencils, and books, making education accessible to all, regardless of age.
          <br/>
          Beyond academics, we focus on instilling values (sanskar), ethics, and life skills to prepare students for a well-rounded future. Our mentorship system, where senior students guide juniors, fosters a culture of support and growth. Additionally, we offer internet access, digital classes, books, and experienced mentors to create a holistic learning environment.
          <br/>
          To sustain this initiative, we introduced the “One Day One Rupee” program, encouraging students to donate one rupee daily from their pocket money, fostering a sense of responsibility. Moreover, generous contributions from society help us support those in need. This trust is a collective effort, driven by the contributions of many, ensuring that education remains a right, not a privilege.

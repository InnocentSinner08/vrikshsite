For children and adults from affluent families in cities, a bicycle is often seen as a recreational item or a means to improve physical fitness. However, for the underprivileged, a bicycle is a crucial mode of transportation, requiring minimal maintenance and having no running costs.Used bicycles are often discarded in housing society premises because they are either broken down or considered outdated and not stylish. Children typically abandon an old bicycle when parents provide a newer model. Donations of old bicycles are aimed at supporting underprivileged girl students in villages. These students face the challenge of attending schools located at great distances, with parents who cannot afford bus fare. As a result, many girl students drop out of school due to this reason.",

It develops a strong learning environment that enhances academic attainment, and develops the social and relationship skills of students that last all their lives. It gives them self-esteem and confidence to explore and develop their full potential. It leaves no student behind, irrespective of his background.Day after day, more traditional educational methods are being replaced by digital learning. Given how rapidly classrooms change, it would be best to forget some methods you may remember when you were in school and think of new ways of teaching and learning with modern tools and technologies in mind. Children also feel very good about mastering new knowledge and skills using digitized learning tools; this gives them the confidence needed to want to learn even more new things.",
